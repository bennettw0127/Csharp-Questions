1. A namespace allows us to organize our code and provide a scope for the identifier we will be using.

2. A value variable contains an instance of the type that is made.

3. A reference variable contains a reference to an instance of the type.

4. Automatic property has backing field generated by the compiler. Automatic property.are used when no additional logic is required and saves a coder time by not having to put in extra unnessecary code.

5. A using a statement uses the using keyword and provides the syntax to specify the scope of the use of a resource object.

6. Dynamic data types do not require initialization at the time of declaration.

7. To determine whether an object is a specific type.

8. Generics are a class that allows you to define other classes and methods as well with the use of a placeholder. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-generics-introduction/)

9. The scope of a public member of a class is a public access specifier. ( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-the-scope-of-a-public-member-variable-of-a-class-in-chash)

10. Yes you can create a function that can accept a varying amount of arguments. You can do this by using the Params keyword and that will accept varying amounts of arguments. 

11. The function Array.Sort will sort an array in ascending order. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-ways-to-sort-an-array-in-descending-order-in-c-sharp/)

12. A nullable type is a non-existent value that is assigned to a value type. (https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-nullable-types)

13. An enumeration is a set of named integer constants. (https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-enum)

14. Inheritance allows for classes to be created and have characteristics that were previously present in a different existing class. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance)

15. C# does not support multiple inheritance. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2456154/does-c-sharp-support-multiple-inheritance)

16. An operator commmunicates with the compiler to perform mathematical or logical functions. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_operators.htm)

17. Any data piece placed into a program is an object. ( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/objects)

18. A class is a blueprint specified by the user that holds objects placed inside while a struct is a data type which holds only one variable that is related to other data types. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-sharp-class-and-object/ and https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_struct.htm)

19. Break statements brake a loop while a continue statement skips the execution and continues. (https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/efa3cf/break-vs-continue-in-C-Sharp/)

20. "This" is used to show the this pointer of a struct or class. It is used when when you have to pass an instance from a current class or current struct to the outside methods or classes. 

21. "Try" and "Catch" are blocks used to handle any exceptions created by the user. (https://stackify.com/csharp-exception-handling-best-practices/)

22. Exception handling is done by using 4 different keywords such as catch, try, throw, and finally. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_exception_handling.htm)

23. The "Finally" statement is used when the try/catch block leaves the execution. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_exception_handling.htm)

24. Array list is used when you want to list multiple data types such as int or char types while an Array is useful for listing only a single data type. 

25. An object is a piece of data that is placed into a program. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/objects)

26. A constructor is used to initialize data in a new object. (https://www.javatpoint.com/c-sharp-constructor)

27. Var is used when a local variable is declared and initialized in the same statement so they do not have namespace contridictions. 

28. Abstract classes are inherited by subclasses that override its method. (https://www.infoworld.com/article/2928719/when-to-use-an-abstract-class-vs-interface-in-c.html)

29. An interface is a collection of declarations which include methods and properties. (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Sharp_Programming/Interfaces)

30. A method is a way to contain and execute the programs statements. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/methods)

31. A property reads and writes the value of a private field. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties)

32. Access specifiers specify who can access an object. They can be made public or private. (http://csharp.net-informations.com/language/csharp-access-specifiers.htm)

33. These are public, private, protected, internal, and internal protected. (https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/84c85b/oop-series-sharp2-understanding-access-specifier-with-C-Sharp/)

34. A collection is a specialized class for retrieval and storing of data. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_collections.htm)

35. A hash table is used when you need to access different elements by using "key" which lets you identify a useful "key" value. (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_hashtable.htm)
